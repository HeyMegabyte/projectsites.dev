  <h3>1. Overview</h3>
  <p>This Content Policy outlines the standards for content created, hosted, and displayed through Project Sites at <a href="https://sites.megabyte.space">sites.megabyte.space</a>. This applies to both user-provided content and AI-generated content.</p>

  <h3>2. AI-Generated Content Standards</h3>
  <p>Our AI generates website content using publicly available business information, including data from Google Places, social media profiles, and public listings. We strive to ensure AI-generated content is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Based on verified public data sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Written in a clear, business-appropriate tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Original:</strong> Uniquely composed for each business, not copied from existing sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliant:</strong> Adhering to applicable advertising and consumer protection laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>When you use Project Sites, you are responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing all AI-generated content for accuracy before publishing.</li>
    <li>Ensuring uploaded images and custom text comply with this policy.</li>
    <li>Maintaining truthful and non-misleading business information.</li>
    <li>Updating content when business information changes.</li>
  </ul>
